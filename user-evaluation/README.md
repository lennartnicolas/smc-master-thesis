## User Evaluation Task Instructions

<div style="text-align: justify">In recent years, 2D sound similarity maps for sample browsing have seen an increase in popularity for musicians and sound designers. Plenty of research has been done to provide several complex projection methods, however still leaving loads of room for improvement. This research project intends to evaluate a different mapping approach for sound browsing compared to the common methods in the industry.

### Quick Installation

<div style="text-align: justify">
The prototype for this evaluation is a simple web application that can be run locally in the browser. It is highly recommended to use <b>Safari</b> due to efficiency reasons. We have two different tasks for four different maps respectively. To setup the interface just <b>navigate to the root
folder</b> in the terminal and run the `setup.py` script:
</div>
<br>

<center>

```
python3 setup.py
```
</center>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">This will run a local server on port 8000 and open the corresponding url with Safari. If you don't have Safari installed, it will open your default browser (which may lower the quality and speed of the application). The webpage should show an empty gray screen with a toggle menu for the maps in the upper left corner and the navigation legend at the bottom right.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">The tasks will be described in the following sections. Make sure to read them carefully. Each task expects you to answer several questions relating the corresponding map. 
For that we provide a google form with the questionnaire that can be found <a href="https://forms.gle/GjinyBFhWWRfvZrx6">here</a>.

### Task 1
<div style="text-align: justify">This task uses the maps labeled <b>M1.1, M1.2, M1.3 and M1.4</b> in the menu in the upper left corner. All maps have different layouts where M1.3 and M1.4 contain additional semantics for each cluster. <b>Please start with M1.1</b> and plot the individual sounds. The map should contain seven main clusters individually colored per group of sounds.
The audio player in the upper right corner contains the target sound that needs to be found within the 2D map. You can listen to the sound as often as you want. When listening to a sound, all its information is displayed in the <b>lower left corner with the unique ID highlighted in yellow</b>.
</div>

### Task 2
<div style="text-align: justify">The second task uses maps labeled <b>M2.1, M2.2, M2.3 and M2.4</b> in the menu in the upper left corner. Both maps have different layouts and do not contain any semantic information. <b>Please start with M2.1</b> and plot the individual sounds. The toggle menu in the upper right corner lets you select <b>three different target sounds</b> that can be played back with the audio player below. For each target sound you should find around ~3 similar sounds that you consider fitting in the same sound category. Please write down the corresponding ID's of each sound per target sound and answer the questions in the attached questionnaire as precisely as possible.
